# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

Radix sort is a sorting technique that sorts the elements by first grouping the individual digits of the same place value. Then, sort the elements according to their increasing/decreasing order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
